Boeing decided to stop the tours when COVID hit, but subsequently never decided to resume them. So what you can do is pay handsomely to watch a video about what you WOULD have seen, but can’t.\n\nThis is a simple management decision. If the federal government is no longer requiring masks on flights, surely you can conduct tours in a building as big as the outdoors.  I can only assume that it’s more profitable NOT to conduct the tours and instead charge people to watch a video, then send them to the gift shop.\n\nEither way, don’t waste your time.",
