In the palace itself there isn’t much to do apart from just walking around and seeing the historic buildings. You also can’t enter any of the buildings which means it can be quite hot in the summer. Personally, I would just do a quick walk around of the palace then head to the two museums either side of the palace as there’s a lot more to see there. The entry fee is quite reasonable and there’s also discounts available.",

There was also live music, which was basically one woman with a guitar singing popular songs with a heavy accent. It was kind of entertaining. After the tour we rented some bikes and road along the river. At the center of the park is the famous Seoul sign with the city behind it. There's also lot's of grass areas to pitch a tent and relax, though camping overnight is forbidden and carries a heavy fine. Don't forget to stop at the many food vendors along the bike trail. The CU has a few hot water stations outside along with microwaves to warm up your noodles. There's also a restaurant attached with outdoor seating and really good fried chicken. We really need to go back and explore more, twice is not enough. Even with COVID we still were able to enjoy the activities and peaceful atmosphere. On a side note I would recommend taking the Han river tour at night if you can.",

The views are spectacular and I loved the added extra bonus of having place names written on the windows with how far away they were. Both my friend and I found the capital cities of our home countries. There is plenty to do around the base of the Tower as well. A few restaurants (although if you're Vegetarian you might struggle to find anything without meat), cafes and convenient stores for you to get food. Plenty of little craft and trinket stalls as well as a few local food stalls. I even got my portrait drawn and framed for 50,000₩ as a birthday gift to myself. I would also recommend couples to go visit. You can buy (or bring) a padlock which you can write a little message on and add it to the 1000s of other padlock that line the walkways and railings all around the Tower. It really is a beautiful sight to see. Plenty of aesthetic photo opportunities too if you're more about that Insta Life. Overall, I would totally recommend you put this on your list of places to visit in Korea.",

I could not go up the tower as I arrived before the opening time, but nevertheless, I would recommend everyone visiting Seoul to check out the N Seoul Tower.",

A great place to spend time, to walk around, getting fresh air, clear the head. Seeing all the trees here is very relaxing. And if you need to grab a bite or quick coffee break, only a quick walk and you will find everything. A great way to spend the afternoon.",

There was also live music, which was basically one woman with a guitar singing popular songs with a heavy accent. It was kind of entertaining. After the tour we rented some bikes and road along the river. At the center of the park is the famous Seoul sign with the city behind it. There's also lot's of grass areas to pitch a tent and relax, though camping overnight is forbidden and carries a heavy fine. Don't forget to stop at the many food vendors along the bike trail. The CU has a few hot water stations outside along with microwaves to warm up your noodles. There's also a restaurant attached with outdoor seating and really good fried chicken. We really need to go back and explore more, twice is not enough. Even with COVID we still were able to enjoy the activities and peaceful atmosphere. On a side note I would recommend taking the Han river tour at night if you can.",

I immediately emailed them and send them pictures to ask about it. However, I waited 2 days and their respond was that they cannot process any refund or compensation for this because they already send it out. They suggest that I file a claim directly to the delivery company for missing items and damaged package. That's it.\nThey are the most irresponsible company I have ever shopped.\nThey do not do anything for my loss! The 5 items that went missing were totalled $85 USD. And I lost $85USD just because of their irresponsibility.\nIs it my fault that the products went missing? Maybe I should never purchased from STYLENANDA in the first place, so that I would not wasted my money at all.\nI purchased the products and do not receive it and they do not do anything about it.\nI will suggest everyone do not buy from them anymore.",

Easily accessible by train or bus which is the preffered method of transportation as parking is VERY limited.\nThis festival is a must if you find yourself close to Seoul in the month of May. There is no entrance fee as it is on a public park.\nIt offers a close look to roses in many colors, and sizez. In adition there is a breathtaking 5.12 km long tunel of roses next to the Jungnangcheon Stream.\nThere are plenty of street vendors and restaurants available to enjoy local food at very affordable prices.\n\nHighly reccomend!",

I would not visit again and would not really recommend to anyone. But that is also partly due to personal bias, I do prefer ancient history to modern history in general. The full room of projectors showing history of advertising was very very well done and that’s why I’m giving 4 stars instead of 3.",

There are English audio guides available (though i recommend to the museum to have English subtitles on the videos projected onto the walls too). I teared up a number of times because the stories are incredibly moving, as is how the museum is set up. How have I never heard about these travesties before? As a woman, I felt connected to women suffering worldwide, and this exhibit has encouraged me to be more of an active activist. I felt proud that my male partner felt the same way after visiting. I highly recommend a visit, and am grateful for the brave survivors telling their stories.",
