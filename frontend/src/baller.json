Personally, I would just do a quick walk around of the palace then head to the two museums either side of the palace as there’s a lot more to see there. The entry fee is quite reasonable and there’s also discounts available.",

Railroad police officers are patrolling for safety purposes and it has a service lounge for ROK and US armed forces as well.\nConsidering that Seoul station is so crowded place especially for Monday, weekends and holidays, sometimes you cannot get tickets that you want.

There was also live music, which was basically one woman with a guitar singing popular songs with a heavy accent. It was kind of entertaining. After the tour we rented some bikes and road along the river. At the center of the park is the famous Seoul sign with the city behind it. There's also lot's of grass areas to pitch a tent and relax, though camping overnight is forbidden and carries a heavy fine. Don't forget to stop at the many food vendors along the bike trail. The CU has a few hot water stations outside along with microwaves to warm up your noodles. There's also a restaurant attached with outdoor seating and really good fried chicken. We really need to go back and explore more, twice is not enough. Even with COVID we still were able to enjoy the activities and peaceful atmosphere. On a side note I would recommend taking the Han river tour at night if you can.",

The views are spectacular and I loved the added extra bonus of having place names written on the windows with how far away they were. Both my friend and I found the capital cities of our home countries. There is plenty to do around the base of the Tower as well. A few restaurants (although if you're Vegetarian you might struggle to find anything without meat), cafes and convenient stores for you to get food. Plenty of little craft and trinket stalls as well as a few local food stalls. I even got my portrait drawn and framed for 50,000₩ as a birthday gift to myself. I would also recommend couples to go visit. You can buy (or bring) a padlock which you can write a little message on and add it to the 1000s of other padlock that line the walkways and railings all around the Tower. It really is a beautiful sight to see. Plenty of aesthetic photo opportunities too if you're more about that Insta Life. Overall, I would totally recommend you put this on your list of places to visit in Korea.",
